All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: The staff solution used a minusone() method to make code more readable! “Any fool can write code computers can understand; a good programmer write code that humans can understand.”

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: The way I used remainder to make my list circular and the clever way of copying the list to the front of the new list when resizing in order to avoid complication.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Particularly inelegant? I am sorry; I am a graceful person.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: How to resize without using ArrayCopy().

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Using a minusone() method, for God’s sake!

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I should have used this.item, this.next, this.prev in my StuffNode Constructor.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I love my private getRecursive method. It feels like using higher-order functions in python but not exactly the same, if you know what I mean.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I wrote repeated code in addFirst() and addLast().

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Seriously, the “ArrayDeque” in the question should be “LinkedListDeque”. 
   I wish I knew that Gradescope would check for code style and there is a “reformat” button in IntelliJ.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would have used a private helper method to create a LinkedList with one element so that I wouldn’t have to write repeated code.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: I don’t have hard feelings about this review process. But using a Google survey form may be more convenient?
